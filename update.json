JEI sync setting (green/red button) is no longer a singleton-per-player-global setting, its saved independently for each remote and block so each can have a different value.  New config jeiMaximumRecipeTags to balance between JEI recipe auto-completion and Server Packet overflow errors.  Fix data tag recipes sometimes not working on servers.  Extra warning tooltip on Network exchange interface.  Fix Server Crash When using red Builder remote.  Update pt_br.json by  Mikeliro.  Fix Import/Export putting random blocks in the Upgrade slots.  Fix tooltip and tag search.  Fix NPE when connecting Network Exchange to certain blocks. Network Exchange interface capped at 5000 instead of 134217727 (greatly reduce lag).
